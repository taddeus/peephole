\section{Introduction}
The goal of the assignment is to implement the optimization stage of the
compiler. To reach this goal the parser part of the compiler has to be
implemented.

The output of the gcc cross compiler on a c program is our input, the output of
the gcc cross compiler is in the form of Assembly code, but not optimized. Our
assignment includes a number of c programs, an important part of the assignment
is parsing the data. Parsing the data is done with lex and yacc. The lexer is a
program that finds keywords that meets the regular expression provided in the
lexer. After the lexer, the yaccer takes over. Yaccer can turn the keywords in
to an action.

\section{Design \& Implementation}
We decided to implement the optimization in python. We chose this programming
language because python is an easy language to manipulate strings, work
objective ori\"ented etc.
It turns out that a lex and yacc are also implemented in a python version,
named PLY(Python Lex-Yacc). This allows us to use one language, Python, instead
of two i.e. C and Python. Also no debugging is needed in C, only in Python
which makes our assignment more feasible.
