Common subexpression elimination

Loop through statements of each block
    for each binary operator, look back for usage of rs and rt. If rs or rt are
    assigned, break. If exact same operator is found, add it to the list of
    common subexpressions. If you reach the end of the block, or rs or rt are
    assigned, make new destination address, and change each occurence of this
    expression with a move from the new register address.
